This is a very basic SQL script containing the complete list of Philippine provinces and each city/municipality underneath. Extremely useful for Filipino developers who are looking for ready-baked data for their projects.

Short History
-------------

I haven't really found a readily-available script from the Internet to get this list from, so I created this list with references from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_and_municipalities_in_the_Philippines).

Technical Details
-----------------

* Generated from MySQL 5.1.57 ISAM tables
* Default length for province/city names is varchar(300)
* Used PHPMyAdmin 3.5.0 with ANSI compatibility for the SQL output

Usage
-----

Just call the file from your favorite CLI client, or import it using a database administration GUI of your choice. :)
